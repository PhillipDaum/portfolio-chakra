## features
- dark mode/ light mode, with a switch with icons - maybe a border, maybe slightly different color- make it sticky. 
- color pallet
--- I'm thinking 
----- bg.subtle or muted, with the cards contrasting, or vice versa
------ maybe the cards have a border and a drop shadow
--- I sorta sorta sorta want it to be similar to the colors from this, I want to make sure it looks hella dope but is also accesible and autism friendly, etc. I can put some of this in the readme
